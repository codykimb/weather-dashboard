DESCRIPTION:  
This Weather Dashboard lets the user search for a city  
and returns the current weather conditions of that city -
including temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index -
along with a 5 day forcast. The UV index is color coded -  
green for low risk, yellow for moderate and red for high.  
The city that is searched is added to the list on the left  
side and saved in local storage. Clicking the Clear History  
button will remove all the previously searched cities.
